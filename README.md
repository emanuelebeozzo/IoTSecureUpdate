# IoTSecureUpdate

This repository contains all the implementation and test material used to propose an extended version of SUIT (Software Updates for Internet of Things). In particular, it includes a fork and extension of the suit-tool reference implementation, developed by ARM (available at: https://gitlab.arm.com/research/ietf-suit/suit-tool) and a fork and extension of the suit-parser, also developed by ARM (available at https://gitlab.arm.com/research/ietf-suit/suit-parser). 

## Content of the repo

The repository is organized as follows:
* the `example` folder contains:
    1. a set of manifest examples (used for testing) with scripts to automate the generation, signing and parsing of the manifests in the folder;
    2. a set of proofs of various properties used for testing with scripts to automate the proof verification. 
* the `suit-tool` folder contains the codebase of the tool to generate and parse the manifests in Python;
* the `tests` folder contains the result of example tested on a Raspberry Pi 4b (quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor running at 1.5 GHz and 2 GB of RAM).
